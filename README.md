If you want to add more accounts under the server make sure that all these things doesnot exceed the limit.If exceeded server load will become more and will stop all the services.

When a server is under high load, chances are that the number of processes in the "wait" queue are growing each second.

mysqldump --databases database_one database_two > two_databases.sql


back up all of the databases on a server:

mysqldump --all-databases > all_databases.sql


=>Restore databases   mysql database_name < database_name.sql
